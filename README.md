# Bidirectional Neighborhood Model

The Bidirectional Neighborhood Model is an adaptation of the KBAT model from the paper: [Learning Attention-based Embeddings for Relation Prediction in Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01195)

The neighborhood model was written over the source code of the [KBAT model](https://github.com/deepakn97/relationPrediction).
